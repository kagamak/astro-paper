> Sometimes, I just feel like I'm falling behind.

In June 2023, I will be graduating from high school. In the past few months since committing to college, I’ve had the time to reflect upon my unique educational experience. Some would consider me to be the standard high-achieving Asian-American high schooler (not saying that’s not true). What is worrisome here is the word “standard.” To expect your teenager to consistently achieve above the level of their peers, especially in this increasingly competitive academic atmosphere, is a stressful and damaging mindset. 

My journey dealing with these expectations has not been easy, compounded by struggles with mental illness. The stigma against mental health in the Asian community, combined with the intense pressure to excel in all aspects of life, has made it challenging to find a balance between mental health and success. In this week’s article, I will share my personal experience with OCD and anxiety, discuss the expectations placed on Asian-American high schoolers, and provide some tips on how I have learned to cope with the stress.

## What stigma is there?

Mental health has long been stigmatized in the Asian community, with many believing that mental illness is a weakness and that seeking help is shameful. In traditional Chinese culture especially, there was a strong emphasis on collectivism and harmony within the community. Mental illness was often viewed as a personal weakness that could disrupt the social order and bring shame to the individual and their family. This belief has prevailed to the present-day where oftentimes superhuman success is demanded from today’s youth.

The pressure to succeed is a significant issue for Asian-American high schoolers. We are expected to stack AP courses, participate in dozens of extracurriculars, and sometimes maintain family responsibilities like helping with the family restaurant. Failure to meet these expectations often lead to feelings of inadequacy and shame. Personally, these expectations had left me embracing the idea of the Infinite Rat Race, and leaving myself to be trampled by it. I, like many others, have had mental illnesses exacerbated by the stress. Especially during the college application season, I found my trichotillomania to be flaring up again with new bald patches where my eyebrows once were. 

## How can we combat the pressure?

Through therapy, I have learned a variety of ways to cope.

### Journaling

Journaling became a therapeutic outlet for me. I found that writing down my thoughts and feelings helped me process them in a healthy way. I would write in my journal before bed or when I felt overwhelmed, and it allowed me to clear my mind and relax. By putting my thoughts down on paper, I was able to identify patterns in my thinking and work on changing negative thought patterns.

### Mindfulness

Mindfulness and meditation also became important tools for me. Mindfulness is the practice of being present in the moment, and meditation is a technique used to achieve a state of calm and relaxation. I began practicing mindfulness by focusing on my breathing and being aware of my surroundings. It helped me become more aware of my thoughts and emotions, and it allowed me to let go of negative thoughts and feelings.

### Meditation

Meditation helped me calm my mind and body. I would sit in a quiet room staring out the window and focus on my breathing. I found that by taking deep breaths and focusing on my breath, I was able to relax and let go of any tension or anxiety that I was feeling. Meditation helped me return to a “Ground Zero” which would set a blank slate for me to concentrate on a new task. I recommend that instead of scrolling through Instagram or TikTok during your breaks, you embrace the feeling of true boredom.

## Takeaways

Being an Asian-American high schooler in this day and age can be challenging, and mental illness can make it even harder. The stigma against mental health in the Asian community and the intense pressure to succeed can make it difficult to find a balance between mental health and success. However, by focusing on the present moment, and setting realistic goals, we can learn to cope with the stress and succeed in a healthy way. Through this blog, I hope to let other teenagers know that they’re not alone in this terribly competitive world. I leave you with a somewhat inspiring quote by Albert Camus on _The Myth of Sisyphus_:

> “The struggle itself is enough to fill a man’s heart.”
