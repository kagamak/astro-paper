  How you can overcome procrastination and maintain the focus bubble

> The average human attention span is now shorten than that of a goldfish.

Procrastination is something that plagues nearly every student at some point in their academic career. Whether it’s putting off a big project until the last minute or struggling to focus on daily homework assignments, we’ve all been there. After four (grueling) years of high school schoolwork, I have solidified five strategies that have helped me get more and more done with less and less effort. Overcoming procrastination and task anxiety is surprisingly possibly! In today’s blog, I will share with you `five techniques I’ve used to become more focused`, as well as apps I use to stay on track with these techniques. 

## Feynman technique to understand concepts quicker

Named after the famous physicist Richard Feynman, the Feynman technique is a powerful method for learning and understanding complex concepts. To use this technique, start by selecting a topic or concept that you need to understand. In my case, that would be the [aggregate expenditure model](https://open.lib.umn.edu/principleseconomics/chapter/28-2-the-aggregate-expenditures-model/) for AP Macroeconomics. Then, try to explain it as simply as possible, as if you were teaching it to someone younger. As you explain the concept, take note of any areas where you struggle or find yourself stumbling over your words. These are the areas that you need to focus on, and the ones that you need to study further.

Personally (and empirically), the Feynman technique is effective because it forces you to confront your own understanding of a topic and see the holes in your knowledge. It’s one thing to read about a concept in a textbook or listen to a lecture, but it’s another thing entirely to be able to explain it in your own words. By breaking down a concept into its simplest components, you can identify where you need to focus your efforts to improve your understanding.

## Spaced repetition to memorize better

Spaced repetition is a technique that leverages the power of your brain’s ability to remember information over time. It works by spacing out your study sessions, so that you review the material at increasingly longer intervals. This has been shown to be much more effective for long-term memory retention than cramming or studying a large amount of material in a short amount of time.

One great tool for implementing spaced repetition is the flashcard app _Anki)_ (kudos to my best friend). With _Anki_, you can create digital flashcards with questions on one side and answers on the other. The app uses an algorithm to determine when you need to review each card, so that you’re reviewing the material at the most effective intervals. Plus, Anki is easy to use and customizable, so you can create flashcards for any subject. If you’re planning on attending medical school, [r/premed](https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/) students love this software!

## Accountability partner to overcome procrastination

When it comes to overcoming procrastination, having an accountability partner can be a powerful tool. An accountability partner is someone who you can check in with regularly to share your goals, progress, and setbacks. This person can help keep you on track and provide encouragement when you need it. 

Ideally, your accountability partner should be someone with similarly rigorous coursework who also needs accountability in their life. Look for someone who is both reliable and supportive. This could be a classmate, friend, or even a family member (probably not a parent, though). Make sure that you establish clear expectations for your check-ins, and be honest about your progress. By holding yourself accountable to someone else, you’ll be more likely to stick to your goals and avoid procrastination.

## Second brain to resolve messy notes

If you’re like most students, you probably have a pile of messy notes from various classes and subjects. But keeping your notes organized is crucial for effective studying and learning. That’s where the concept of a “second brain” comes in.

A second brain is simply a digital repository for all of your notes, ideas, and resources. It could be a note-taking app like Notion or even just a folder on your computer. The key is to have one central location where you can store all of your notes and access them easily.

By using a second brain, you can keep your notes organized and searchable. Plus, you can add tags and annotations to help you find specific information quickly. This will save you time and reduce the stress of trying to find that one important notes document from December.

## Pomodoro Technique to stay focused

Using the Pomodoro Technique is one of the most effective ways to get started on schoolwork and avoid procrastination. This technique involves breaking up your workday into small, manageable chunks, typically around 25 minutes long. During each Pomodoro session, you focus exclusively on the task at hand, without any distractions.

After each Pomodoro session, you take a five-minute break to rest and recharge. After four Pomodoro sessions, you take a longer break, typically around 15 to 20 minutes. This technique helps to keep you focused and motivated, and also gives you regular breaks to rest your mind and recharge your batteries. Though you could use your phone or a computer tab as a timer, I recommend purchasing a physical timer like this [cute tomato one](https://www.amazon.com/yueton-Kitchen-Mechanical-Minutes-Rotating/dp/B07H59ZL1L/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=pomodoro+timer+tomato&qid=1682975758&sr=8-3) to keep your eyes away from screens.

## Takeaways

In summary, overcoming procrastination and getting focused on schoolwork requires a combination of strategies and techniques. The methods I have listed above here will most likely help you conquer procrastination and achieve academic success. Remember: holding yourself accountable is the first step in achieving greatness.
