Recovering from an eating disorder is a difficult process that requires dedication and commitment. It can be particularly challenging to manage while also trying to succeed in school. As someone who had to manage both of these simultaneously, I know how important it is to prioritize both recovery and academic success. In this week’s post, I will discuss some of the strategies I have used to stay healthy while achieving in school.

## Meal Prepping

Meal prepping is a key strategy for managing eating disorder recovery. By planning out meals in advance, you can ensure that you have healthy, nourishing food available to you at all times. I find that prepping meals on Sundays when teenagers have the time to be most effective. While struggling with my eating disorder, I followed a dangerous cycle of binging, purging, and restricting. The extremely unhealthy award system this created mentally is what perpetuated the cycle. Periods of instant noodle binges were followed by days-long periods of immense guilt. 

By creating meals in advance, we hold ourselves to a schedule and sense of structure to follow, instead of allowing ourselves to succumb to the impulses of nearby junk food. By following a consistent meal schedule, our stomach physiology will subsequently adjust so that we become less ravenously hungry.

## Scheduled meals

When I first started recovering from my eating disorder, I struggled to eat regular meals. I would skip meals or only eat small amounts of food and instead studied, which left me feeling weak and tired. Other days, I would eat mindlessly to the point of extreme bloating in order to cope with the stress of a bad grade. After I was enrolled into therapy through my eating disorder clinic, I was advised to keep a small journal that detailed my schedule today with a meal plan for three meals. By incorporating meals into my daily schedule as another task rather than a reward, I slowly dissolved the unhealthy relationship I had with food.

## Choosing the Right Breakfast Foods

Breakfast is often referred to as the most important meal of the day, and it is for good reason. When you break it apart, breakfast is just “breaking the fast.” It is the first meal of your day, and that first meal can be 6 AM, 9 AM, or even 12 PM. The time you eat doesn’t matter too much. What matters is the food you choose to eat. A healthy breakfast can set the tone for the rest of the day and help to stabilize blood sugar levels. 

I found that eating a breakfast that was high in protein and fiber helped me to feel full and satisfied throughout the morning. Some of my favorite breakfast options included oatmeal with fruit and nuts, scrambled eggs with veggies, and _Oui_ yogurt with berries and granola. If you don’t have time to cook in the mornings, meal prepping or pre-packaged yogurts are great alternatives.

## Eating snacks

Having snacks throughout the day is another important strategy for managing eating disorder recovery. When I was in the throes of my bulimia, I was afraid to eat between meals. I thought that if I ate a snack, I would lose control and binge. But as I began to recover, I realized that snacking was actually a healthy way to fuel my body and prevent overeating at mealtimes. Some of my favorite snacks included fruit and nut butter, hummus and veggies, and yogurt with granola.

## Takeaways

Managing your time well is crucial for managing your eating disorder recovery whilst also succeeding academically. It can be difficult to find time to eat when you are busy with schoolwork, but it is important to prioritize self-care. By keeping your brain fueled, not only will you physically feel better, but your mind will perform better. I found that setting aside specific times for meals and snacks helped me to stay on track, as well as incorporating breaks into my schedule. I hope that these strategies can provide some basis to teenagers looking to bounce back from their eating disorders.
