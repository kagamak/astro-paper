Recently, I watched a [TedTalk](https://youtu.be/MyD0m7JXgjA) on the so-called "trauma dump essay."

## Why are students doing this?

In recent years, there has been a noticeable trend in college applications where students feel compelled to share their personal traumas and hardships in what has become known as the "trauma dump essay." These essays often revolve around deeply personal experiences such as abuse, mental health struggles, loss of a loved one, or other significant life challenges. The intention behind these essays is to evoke sympathy and create a strong emotional impact on the admissions officers.

The main reason behind this phenomenon is the increasing pressure students face in the highly competitive college admissions process. With more students vying for limited spots at prestigious institutions, the desire to stand out and make an impression is stronger than ever. Many students believe that by sharing their traumatic experiences, they can differentiate themselves from the sea of applicants and gain an advantage.

## How harmful is the trauma dump essay?

While it is understandable that students want to showcase their resilience and personal growth in the face of adversity, the trauma dump essay can have unintended negative consequences. First and foremost, it is important to acknowledge that these essays can be retraumatizing for the students themselves. Reliving and recounting painful experiences in such a public manner can reopen wounds and lead to emotional distress.

Furthermore, there is a risk that admissions officers may not respond to these essays in the way students hope. While some may empathize and appreciate the student's resilience, others may question whether the trauma will affect the student's ability to thrive academically or socially in a college environment. Admissions officers are primarily looking for students who can contribute positively to their campus community, and focusing solely on one's past struggles may not necessarily showcase their potential for growth and achievement.

## Does this theme extend past the essays?

The trauma dump essay is not an isolated phenomenon limited to college application essays. In recent years, there has been a broader cultural shift towards sharing personal struggles and traumas on various platforms, including social media. This trend is partly driven by the desire for validation, support, and connection. However, it is crucial to consider the potential consequences of such oversharing.

The normalization of discussing deeply personal and traumatic experiences in public spaces can perpetuate a cycle of retraumatization. It may also create an environment where personal worth is measured by the severity of one's struggles, further exacerbating feelings of inadequacy and competition.

## So what do we do?

To address the issue of the trauma dump essay, it is essential for students, parents, educators, and admissions officers to engage in open conversations about mental health, resilience, and personal growth. Here are a few steps that can be taken:

- Encourage self-reflection: Students should be encouraged to reflect on their experiences, but also to consider how they have grown and overcome challenges. This can help them present a more holistic picture of themselves rather than solely focusing on their traumas.
-   Provide support: Schools and colleges should ensure that students have access to mental health resources and counseling services. This can help students process their experiences in a safe and supportive environment.
-   Educate on essay writing: Students should receive guidance on effective storytelling techniques that highlight their strengths, passions, and aspirations. They can learn to present their personal journeys in a way that demonstrates resilience and growth, without solely relying on the shock value of traumatic experiences.
-   Holistic review process: Admissions officers can play a role in mitigating the trauma dump essay by focusing on a holistic review process. This includes considering academic achievements, extracurricular involvement, community service, and letters of recommendation. By evaluating applicants from a more comprehensive perspective, colleges can ensure they admit students who have the potential to thrive in their environment.

The trauma dump essay reflects the intense pressure students feel in the college admissions process. While sharing personal experiences can be powerful, it is important to consider the potential harm it may cause to the applicants themselves and the effectiveness in conveying their overall potential. By fostering a supportive environment and providing guidance, we can help students present their unique stories in a way that truly showcases their growth, resilience, and future aspirations.
