## Education and Activities

At <font color="text-yellow">Roslyn High School</font> in Long Island, New York, I held leadership positions in my three areas of interest: human biology, language, and music! When I attend Brown in the fall, I hope to continue pursuing these interests through coursework and student organizations.

- Roslyn High School (2019-2023): Science Olympiad (Biology Captain), World Language Honor Society (President), Marching Band (Low Winds Captain), Science Quiz Bowl, Varsity Quiz Bowl, Science National Honor Society, Tri-M Music Honor Society
- Brown University (2023-2027): TBD ʕ •ᴥ•ʔ

## Experience

Here is some of the work I've done/do outside of school. As you may be able to tell, public service and biomedical research are where I focus a lot of my efforts. After I graduate from Brown, I aim to pursue an MD/PhD to become a physician-scientist. Currently, I'm very interested in the intersection of pathogen genomics and environmental epidemiology (╯✧▽✧)╯.
